# PCT EET320 Utilities
Two Python utilities for EET320/EET321 at the Pennsylvania College of Technology.</br>
</br>
To use, download PCT_EET320.py to the same folder where the lab Python code is stored.</br>
At the top of the file with the other imports, include the following:
```Python
import PCT_EET320 as pct
```
This allows either function to be called with the prefix `pct.`
